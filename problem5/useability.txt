Here's breakcdown of impact of changing access modifiers:-

Data Security:
1. Public : This is widely accessible. Any class can access the member of this. This offers minimal security and should be used cautiously. This is mostly used for Constants.

2. Protected : This provides accessibolity within the same package. The subclass from other package also can access this. It offers a balanced security.

3. Default : This offers accessibility only in same package. It provides a middle ground for data security within the package.

4. Private : This is most secure and only accessible within class itself. It prevents access from other class or subclass. It provd

Class Usability:

Public: Class and its members can be accessed from anywhere in the program. Increases reusability but can lead to tight coupling between classes if not used carefully.
Protected: Class can only be subclassed by classes in the same package or subclasses in other packages. Enforces a degree of control over who can use the class.
Default (Package-private): Class can only be used by other classes within the same package. Promotes modularity and reduces complexity in large projects.
Private: Class cannot be accessed from outside the current file. Useful for helper classes or internal utility classes that are not meant for external use.
